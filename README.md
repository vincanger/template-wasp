# A Wasp template on Gitpod

<img src="./MyNewApp/src/client/waspLogo.png" width='100px'/>

This is a [Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev/) template configured for ephemeral developer environments on [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).

Inside this template is a simple ToDo app complete with Authentication, Database Entities, and Client & Server Operations. 

* Look for the `main.wasp` file within the `MyNewApp` directory to see how a Wasp App is built! 
* The `src` directory contains your client and server files that you edit and reference within `main.wasp`
* Wasp uses this information to put all the pieces of your app together, so you can focus on the important stuff (you can see what Wasp builds in `.wasp/out`, but **don't** edit these files üêù)!
